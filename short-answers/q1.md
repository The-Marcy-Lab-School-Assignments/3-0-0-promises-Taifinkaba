# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` would print first because `console.log` is a  sync type code while `Inside promise` is a async type code. Synchronous code runs first while asynchronous code takes time to run even when the timer is at 0 seconds.

# Teacher Feedback

console.log is not a promise! Can you explain why it matters if it is asynchronous code v synchronous code?
