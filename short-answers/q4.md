# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
`resolve` is when the promise is fulfilled. It is a async function and it's job is to produce a result when a promise is given. `reject` is when the  promise fails or gets denied. It's also async but it's job is to tell you that the request you made failed which is a way to give the program a out instead of staying in a loop.  `resolve/reject` is like `if/else`, `if` the function passes we do  `resolve` or `else` return `reject`.
